# Pivo-Slayer

This is an application intended to serve as the course project for tsoha 
at HYY.

The application is available (without any features) at [https://pivo-slayer.herokuapp.com/](https://pivo-slayer.herokuapp.com/).

## Purpose

I am going to slay Pivo. You took everything from me. All of my categories... gone.

Pivo-Slayer is a database app that will allow users to import account transactions and set categories for them.

The aim is to allow category-based spending analysis on a monthly and/or weekly basis to help users understand their cash flow and plan their personal economy.
