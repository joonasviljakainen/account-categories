# Pivo-Slayer: User Stories


## Core goals
As a user, I want to...

- To feed transactions into the system so I can gather all my transaction data in one place
- Browse my transactions by day, week, and month
- See a summary of my spending and income by day, week, and month
- Set categories for transactions
- be able to select whether the selected category should be applied to all transactions with the same counterparty
- See my spending per each category this month and past months 
- When adding a new transaction, I want a category to be set automatically if the same counterparty has already appeared in previous transactions.
- Be sure my transactions are not shown to anyone else.

## Stretch goals

As a user, I want to...

- import an official bank statement (OP, possibly Nordea) and the transactions will be automatically processed and categorized
- Set transactions as recurring, so that I can make better projections 
- See a simple projection of my balance based on average daily spending and known recurring transactions.
