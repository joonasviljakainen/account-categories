# Instructions

This page will tell you how to use Pivoslayer.

## Registering and login

You are free to create a new account. We'll need a name to call you by, a username, and a password. After registering, you can log in, after which you will be redirected to a list of your accounts.

## Managing accounts 

Create a bank account and give it a name. Specify how much money is available on the account *right now* - transactions that you add will affect the account balance. The balance will only be altered when transactions are added whose booking date is after the date of creation of the account.

Click on an account to see its details.

## Creating & managing transactions

Transactions can be added by clicking on the "Add transaction" tab in the nav bar.

Importantly, you can choose which account the transaction belongs to. You must also set a category for the transaction.

It is important to make sure that you specify whether the transaction was made **by you** or **to you**.

By opening the _categories_ tab you can create new categories that you can then attach to each transaction. By clicking on a category, you can see the transactions you have attached to that category from each account.

## Account summaries

The Account Summary view, accessible via the view of a single account. You can see visualized summaries of the categories and transactions of each account. Currently, the views available cover the current month, current year, and all time.

## Admin view

The admin view is a technical demonstration of authorization capabilities. At this moment, it only shows basic information about the number of transactions and registered users.
