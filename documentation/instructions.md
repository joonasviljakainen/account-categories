# Instructions

This page will tell you how to use Pivoslayer.

## Registering and login

You are free to create a new account. We'll need a name to call you by, a username, and a password. After registering, you can log in.

## Creating accounts 

Create a bank account and give it a name. Specify how much money is available on the account *right now* - transactions that you add will affect the account balance. (TODO: the balance will only be altered when transactions are added whose booking date is after the date of creation of the account.)

## Creating & managing transactions

Importantly, you can choose which account the transaction belongs to. You must also set a category for the transaction.

It is important to make sure that you specify whether the transaction was made **by you** or **to you**.

By opening the _categories_ tab you can create new categories that you can then attach to each transaction.
